### LOSTDataset

This is a library to handle datasets generated by LOST. LOSTDataset enables 
directily producing semantic segmentations, anno-type transformations (i.e. polygon to bbox), 
anno-style transformations (i.e. bbox xywh -> bbox x1x2y1y2), crop datasets, 
visualize annotations and some more.

Checkout some explanation and examples [here](https://github.com/l3p-cv/lost_ds/blob/master/examples/example.ipynb).
